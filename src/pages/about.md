My name is Sergei Orlov and I'm a software developer. I currently live in Moscow, Russia.

When I code, I mostly do it in TypeScript. Mainly, I specialize in Node but I'm into
front-end development as well. I have experience as a software architect and solution architect
on several high load projects of well-known companies like `NDA` and `NDA`.

The symbol I use on this website (`||l`) derives from my last name: `Orlov -> Orlove -> ||love -> ||l`.
That's all geeky stuff, I know. I don't run mad after my jokes either.

In this blog, I write about my experience with defining software architecture, using various styles and
patterns, documenting stuff that may help develop and maintain the project,
building warm and welcoming teams, and many other things. I also share some of my dev-related
content on [Raini](https://raini.dev).

Apart from my job, I enjoy meeting people, spending time with my family and building space
ships in my head. I write about things I like on [social media](/contacts) and [here in my blog](/).
